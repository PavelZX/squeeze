# Fitbit on Phoenix

## Overview
I would like to build something to download my fitbit and strava data. I'm not sure how far I am going to get on this.

## Goals

- [x] Deploy on heroku
- [ ] Connect via oauth to fitbit api
- [ ] Learn phoenix along the way

## Basic Phoenix Stuff

To start your Phoenix server:

  * Install dependencies with `mix deps.get`
  * Create and migrate your database with `mix ecto.create && mix ecto.migrate`
  * Install Node.js dependencies with `cd assets && npm install`
  * Start Phoenix endpoint with `mix phx.server`

Now you can visit [`localhost:4000`](http://localhost:4000) from your browser.

Ready to run in production? Please [check our deployment guides](http://www.phoenixframework.org/docs/deployment).
