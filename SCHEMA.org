* Squeeze Schema
** Accounts
*** Users

Stores the name and common information for a user. This is pretty obvious.

- [string] first_name
- [string] last_name
- [string] description
- [string] avatar
- [string] city
- [string] state
- [string] country

*** Credentials

Stores the data to connect to one of the services. Right now only, we will only have strava.

- [string] provider - will be `strava` until another authentication method is supported
- [string] token - token from strava that will be used to get the information
- [string] uid - unique identifier for the user on strava (used for authentication)
- belongs_to user

** Data
*** Activities

Activities are where the strava integration comes in. An activity holds the data
about a run that has already been completed. Eventually we will match up the
events with activities and display if the pace/distance/time was sufficient to
mark the workout as complete.

- [string] name
- [float] distance (in meters)
- [integer] duration
- [datetime] start_at
** Dashboard
*** Goals

Every user has one current goal and many past goals. Goals are a distance and a
pace. An example of a goal would be to run a 3 hour marathon.

- [float] distance (in meters)
- [integer] duration (in seconds)
- [string] name (optional) - the name of your race. Most goals will be for a given race.
- [date] date (optional) - date to accomplish the goal.
- belongs_to user

*** Paces

Paces are a little bit more complicated. A user has many paces and a pace
includes a modifier on the users current goal. Seems confusing right? Yeah I'm
not sure exactly how this will work yet.

Here are some basic paces based on our goal above:

| Workout  | Pace per mile | Modifier        |
|----------+---------------+-----------------|
| Easy     |          8:52 | goal + 120 secs |
| Tempo    |          6:52 | goal + 0 secs   |
| Speed    |          6:17 | goal - 35 secs  |
| Strength |          6:42 | goal - 10 secs  |
| Long     |          7:22 | goal + 30 secs  |

- [string] name - the name of the pace e.g. Easy, Tempo, Long
- [integer] offset - number of seconds difference from goal pace
- belongs_to user

*** Events (Workout)

Events for the most part are planned runs. They belong to a user and a pace.
They hold the distance or time to be covered in the run. For example, today's
event could be 10 miles at the easy pace. This means I should run 10 miles
around 8:52 a mile.

- [string] name (optional) - Name of the event or workout
- [float] distance (in meters) - Distance of the content of the workout. This does not include warmup or cooldown.
- [date] date
- [boolean] warmup - whether this workout needs a warmup
- [boolean] cooldown - whether this workout needs a cooldown
- belongs_to user
- belongs_to pace
